# Predictive Maintenance Optimization with Prophet and Python
### This project utilizes the Facebook Prophet model and Python to forecast maintenance time trends, enabling more informed decision-making. By applying advanced time series forecasting techniques, the goal is to minimize downtime, optimize resource allocation, and effectively prioritize critical tasks.

## Problem Statement
----
As the primary bottler of Coca-Cola products in the Western United States, Swire Coca-Cola's operational efficiency affects the entire distribution network. Despite achieving 94% mechanical efficiency, unforeseen machine breakdowns and inadequate predictive maintenance lead to significant downtime. This shortfall in meeting demand results in an annual loss of approximately $60 million in uncaptured revenue. The current process—issuing work orders, waiting for parts, and making repairs—often lacks the foresight to prevent these downtimes, leading to extended production stoppages and impacting overall performance.

### Maintenance scheduling for machinery often involves reactive measures, resulting in unplanned downtimes and inefficiencies. This project addresses these challenges by:
Forecasting Workload: Using historical workload data to predict future maintenance needs.
Identifying Critical Jobs: Flagging high-priority jobs with significant workload or operational importance.
